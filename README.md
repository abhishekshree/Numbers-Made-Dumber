# Numbers-Made-Dumber
Will keep assignments for the STAMATICS Project here.

## Week 1
This week was on Euclids Algorithm for GCD and Bezout's identity basically. Nice problems 5, 9 (very weird inequality appeared) , 10 (thought a smart reduction for gcd).

## Week 2
This week was about prime and primality test. Got to know about an interesting algorithm to check for large primes [Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_primality_test). Rest of it was relatively easier than the previous week.
