# Numbers-Made-Dumber
Will keep assignments for the STAMATICS Project here.

## Week 1
This week was on Euclids Algorithm for GCD and Bezout's identity basically. Nice problems 5, 9 (very weird inequality appeared) , 10 (thought a smart reduction for gcd).

---

## Week 2
This week was about prime and primality test. Got to know about an interesting algorithm to check for large primes [Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_primality_test). Rest of it was relatively easier than the previous week.  

---

## Week 3
This week was about Congruences and Chinese Remainder Theorem. Difficult week, didn't understood 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> problem of the assignment.

---

## Week 4
This was the last week of the project. Explored how RSA encryption works. Read about [Miller-Rabin Primality Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) and some [Group Theory](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/understanding-the-number-theory-behind-rsa-encryption/). Implemented the RSA Encryption from scratch this week as an exercise in Haskell.
